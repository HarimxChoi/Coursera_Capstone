## The Battle of Neighborhoods
 # Introduction
   A large auto parts company, Best Auto Parts Ltd, is finding area for new branch in South Korea.
  They find the right place for their new factory site in Gyeonggi-do.
  So, to decide new factory site we should consider the transport infrastructure(ex.rail way, harbor, airport), 
  labor level of Gyeonggi-do, residential area and other SOC level, customer factory's distance(ex. GM, Hyudai, Kia),
  , and most of all Land price.
